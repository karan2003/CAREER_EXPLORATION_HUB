<ul>
<li><strong>Software developers</strong>: They design, develop, test, and maintain software applications and systems that run on computers, mobile devices, or the web. They use programming languages, frameworks, and tools to create software products and solutions that meet the specifications and requirements of their clients and users.</li>
<li><strong>Web developers</strong>: They create and maintain websites and web applications that run on the internet or intranets. They use web technologies, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, etc. to design, code, and implement web pages and features that are user-friendly, functional, and attractive.</li>
<li><strong>Database administrators</strong>: They manage and maintain databases that store and organize data for various purposes and applications. They use database management systems, such as SQL, Oracle, MySQL, etc. to create, modify, backup, restore, and secure databases and ensure their optimal performance and availability.</li>
<li><strong>Network administrators</strong>: They plan, install, configure, and maintain networks that connect computers and devices within an organization or across the internet. They use network devices, such as routers, switches, firewalls, etc. to ensure the network's functionality, security, and efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Information security analysts</strong>: They protect the information and systems of an organization or a client from unauthorized access, use, modification, or destruction. They use security tools, such as antivirus, encryption, firewall, etc. to monitor, detect, prevent, and respond to cyberattacks and threats.</li>
<li><strong>Computer support specialists</strong>: They provide technical assistance and support to computer users who encounter problems or issues with their hardware, software, or network. They use troubleshooting techniques, diagnostic tools, and communication skills to identify, analyze, and resolve computer-related problems and queries.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just some of the examples of IT careers that you can pursue. There are many other IT roles and specialties that you can explore and choose from, depending on your interests, skills, and goals.</p>
<h2>IT Degree Programs</h2>
<p>To enter IT domain, you will need to have a relevant and recognized degree in IT or a related field. IT degree programs vary widely depending on the institution issuing the credential. From traditional colleges and universities to accredited online and distance learning degree programs, educational opportunities are available to suit nearly any budget or schedule.</p>
<p>Some schools offer certificate courses in specialized areas of IT, such as web development, database administration, network security, etc. These courses are usually short-term and focused, and they can help you gain specific skills and knowledge in a particular IT domain. However, they may not be sufficient or recognized for some IT careers or positions that require a higher level of education or qualification.</p>
<p>Other schools offer associate, bachelor's, or master's degree programs in IT or a related field, such as computer science, software engineering, information systems, etc. These programs are designed to produce well-rounded students with broad-based knowledge and skills in many different areas of IT. They usually cover topics such as programming, data structures, algorithms, databases, networks, operating systems, software engineering, web development, information security, etc. They also include general education courses, such as mathematics, physics, English, etc. to enhance the students' academic and professional competencies.</p>
<p>Depending on the level and duration of the program, an IT degree can take anywhere from two to six years to complete. The admission requirements and tuition fees also vary depending on the school and the program. Generally, you will need to have a high school diploma or equivalent, and meet the minimum GPA and standardized test scores required by the school. You may also need to submit letters of recommendation, personal statements, or portfolios to demonstrate your interest and aptitude for IT.</p>
<h2>Online and Hybrid IT Degree Programs</h2>
<p>If you are looking for IT degree programs, you'll find both on-campus and distance-based choices. An online program could be a good choice if you want to enroll in a school that is far away, but not move from where you live. Online IT degree programs come in many different shapes and sizes. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hybrid programs</strong>: These are a blend of campus-based and distance learning courses. You will need to attend some classes on campus, while completing others online. This can give you the best of both worlds, as you can benefit from the flexibility and convenience of online learning, as well as the interaction and support of face-to-face learning.</li>
<li><strong>Fully online programs</strong>: These are programs that are delivered entirely online, without any campus visits or requirements. You will access all the course materials, assignments, lectures, discussions, and exams through an online platform or learning management system. You will also communicate and collaborate with your instructors and classmates through email, chat, video conferencing, etc. This can give you the most freedom and flexibility, as you can study at your own pace and place, without any geographical or time constraints.</li>
<li><strong>Accelerated online programs</strong>: These are programs that are designed to help you complete your degree faster than the normal duration. You will take more courses per term, or take courses that are shorter and more intensive than the regular ones. This can help you save time and money, as well as advance your career sooner. However, you will also need to have more dedication and discipline, as the workload and pace will be more demanding and challenging.</li>
<li><strong>Joint degree programs</strong>: These are programs that allow you to earn two degrees at the same time, or in a shorter time than earning them separately. For example, you can earn a bachelor's and a master's degree in IT in five years, instead of six. Or, you can earn a degree in IT and another field, such as business, engineering, or education. This can help you broaden your knowledge and skills, as well as increase your career options and opportunities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most online IT degree programs also use an interactive learning management system that allows you to submit assignments, ask questions, and have discussions with other students. You will also have access to various online resources and services, such as libraries, tutoring, counseling, etc. to support your learning and success.</p>
<h2>How to Choose an IT Degree Program</h2>
<p>Choosing an IT degree program can be a daunting task, as there are many factors and options to consider. Here are some tips to help you make an informed and wise decision:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Identify your goals and interests</strong>: Before you start looking for IT degree programs, you should have a clear idea of what you want to achieve and what you are passionate about. What kind of IT career do you want to pursue? What kind of IT skills and knowledge do you want to acquire? What kind of IT projects or problems do you want to work on? These questions can help you narrow down your choices and find the programs that match your goals and interests.</li>
<li><strong>Research the programs and schools</strong>: Once you have a list of potential IT degree programs, you should do some research and compare them based on various criteria, such as curriculum, accreditation, reputation, faculty, cost, duration, admission requirements, graduation outcomes, etc. You can use online tools, such as [College Navigator](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/), [U.S. News & World Report](https://zapier.com/blog/markdown-html-export/), [Niche](https://zapier.com/blog/beginner-ultimate-guide-markdown/), etc. to find and evaluate IT degree programs and schools.</li>
<li><strong>Consider your preferences and circumstances</strong>: You should also consider your personal preferences and circumstances when choosing an IT degree program. For example, do you prefer to study on campus or online? Do you have the time and money to complete a full-time or part-time program? Do you have any prior work or academic experience in IT? Do you have any special needs or accommodations? These factors can affect your decision and satisfaction with your chosen program.</li>
<li><strong>Seek advice and feedback</strong>:

                  <p class="card-text">
                    Engineering is the application of science and maths to solve
                    problems. Engineers figure out how things work and use for
                    scientific discoveries. Scientists and inventors often get
                    credit for innovations that advance human condition, but it
                    is the engineers who are instrumental in making these
                    innovatons available to the global population. Engineering
                    is one of the corner stones of STEM(science, technology,
                    engineering, mathematics) education, an interdisciplinary
                    curriculum designed to motivate students to learn about the
                    evolving world. A career in engineering requires continual
                    professional development to remain relevant and effective in
                    today's rapidly changing global society. There are currently
                    more than 15 million engineers across various disciplines
                    worldwide and with the surge in technological advancements
                    and preparedness, anyone can be a part of it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Engineering spreads over multiple fields such as
                    bio-engineering to the more common mechanical engineering
                    courses. Engineering is a hands-on course that relies more
                    on practicality and not theory based studies. However,
                    engineering optons such as software engineering offer the
                    rare pleasure of being a mind based field where traditional
                    college institutions as well as highly-acclaimed online
                    programmes strive to provide high grade content and
                    knowledge. All is not lost though, since engineering favours
                    both the active and passive. An engineering degree takes
                    upto tho 5 years to acquire whereas the masters and PhDs
                    take 2 years each.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To successfully design and engineer solutions for today's
                    and tomorrow's rapidly changing and expanding global
                    contexts, in which people are confronted with new
                    opportunities and challenges each day, engineering programs
                    should be training their students to become broad based
                    professionals, who are aware of the actual needs, values and
                    behaviors of the people that use their solutions in their
                    everyday life, work or play. This paper argues that in order
                    to built such an awareness, engineering students should
                    acquire direct, first-hand experiences of real people in
                    real contexts. It presents a number of techniques that can
                    be used to gain such experiences.

                    Engineering opens a learner up to greater heights with the
                    right skills and mindset. It is important to point out that
                    engieering experiences an influx of aspiring students each
                    and every year making it a highly competitive field where
                    the resilient and committed survive to emerge on top.
                    However, don not forget to have fun while you are at it. The
                    field enables you to interact with new technology and people
                    with various banks of knowledge to offer in your journey
                    from an amateur aspirant to a fully-fledged engineer and put
                    you well above most in the job market, let alone equip you
                    with skills to solve some of the world's problems.

                  <p class="card-text">
                    Home Economics offers a range of exciting career options
                    related to foods, nutrition, housing and clothing. Most home
                    economists teach in various types of educational
                    institutions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Some work closely with the media to promote products. Others
                    conduct research in an area of personal interest in this
                    field. Most home economists supervise at least one other
                    employee.
                  </p>
                  <p>More specialized aspects include:</p>
                  <p>
                    Counselling: home economics counselling is given informally
                    and is aimed at developing every family member within the
                    familyâ€™s income and their physical, mental and intellectual
                    abilities. Individuals, organizations and associations are
                    provided with information by means of projects and
                    demonstrations, posters, audio-visual aids, pictures,
                    pamphlets, placards, cookbooks, etc.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Journalism: the press, radio and television offer
                    interesting opportunities for a person who is original and
                    creative. The home economist may become a journalist on a
                    full-time, part-time or freelance basis. Many home
                    economists write books or columns for newspapers and
                    magazines.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Home economists work in a very large variety of work
                    settings. The actual setting is determined by the type,
                    size, location and financial resources of the employer, and
                    by the speciality, experience and education of the home
                    economist. Some positions require evening work and extensive
                    travel.
